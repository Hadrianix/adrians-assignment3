urn this mockup into an html page using only bootstrap classes. The only css you are allowed to use is applying a background-image, background-size. and background-position on the hero section.  What I will be giving marks for:  1 - Is there a pricing section, about this company section, and steps section. 2 - Do all the links take me to the correct section 3 - Is there a Mobile Menu 4 - Is it responsive
